Pin Mapping:
In the designed circuit, an OLED display has been connected to ESP32 with its ground wire connected to ground, voltage wire connected to voltage (3V3), SCL connected to pin 22 and SDA connected to pin 21. Red LED has been connected in such a way that its negative side is grounded and on positive side, 1 kilo ohm resistor is connected and that resistor is connected to pin 18. There is one push button in the circuit also. To connect button, take any of two pairs and use both pins. One pin is attached to voltage and to the other pin, 10 kilo ohm resistor is attached. The resistor side connected to button pin is then connected to GPIO 36 and the other side of resistor is grounded. The buzzer is attached such that the positive side has been connected to GPIO 19 and negative side is grounded.
